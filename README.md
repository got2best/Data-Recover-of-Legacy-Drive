# Data-Recover-of-Legacy-Drive
Recovered over a decade of personal media files from a legacy 4TB hard drive using MiniTool and Windows CLI tools, including data validation via MD5 hashing.

## **Project: Data Recovery of Legacy 4TB Drive Using MiniTool & Windows Native Tools**

**Overview:**

Successfully recovered lost media and document files from a ~14–15-year-old 4TB external hard drive using MiniTool Data Recovery and Windows native tools (`diskpart`, `chkdsk`). This project showcases my hands-on skills in data recovery, system tools, and file integrity validation.

---

### **Background:**

The drive was a portable 4TB external hard drive originally purchased from Fry’s Electronics when I was around 18 years old. Recently, I rediscovered it while searching for old personal media files — including videos, photos, and documents — many of which had sentimental and irreplaceable value. Upon connecting it, I found that the operating system could not detect a usable file system, and the drive appeared as unallocated space.

---

### **Technical Challenge:**

- Legacy drive showed no active partitions or usable file system.
- Risk of overwriting or permanently losing files due to age and corruption.
- Required working with unfamiliar or legacy file formats and structures.

---

### **Tools & Environment:**

- **Operating Systems:** Windows 10 and Windows 11
- **Software:** MiniTool Data Recovery (Free Edition)
- **Command Line Tools:** `diskpart`, `chkdsk`, and `md5sum` utilities for cleanup and integrity checking
- **Hardware:** 4TB USB portable hard drive (approx. 14–15 years old)

---

### **Process & Methodology:**

1. **Detection & Scanning:**
    - Launched MiniTool and identified the 4TB unallocated disk.
    - Initiated a deep scan that took several hours to complete, scanning sectors for lost files.
2. **File Recovery:**
    - Recovered thousands of files, primarily media files:
        - **Photos:** `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.png`, and others
        - **Videos:** `.mkv`, `.avi`, `.mov`, etc.
        - **Documents:** Word and text files, though the drive was mostly used for media storage.
    - A very small percentage of files were corrupted beyond recovery — the vast majority were successfully restored.
3. **System Tools & Cleanup:**
    - After recovery, used `diskpart` to clean the drive and repartition it for future use.
    - Explored and experimented with command-line options in `chkdsk` and `diskpart` to better understand available repair and partitioning features.
4. **Validation:**
    - Verified recovered file integrity using **MD5 hashing**, comparing original and recovered checksums where possible.

---

### **Results & Takeaways:**

✅ **Recovered years of personal media** from a drive that initially appeared unreadable.

✅ **Preserved valuable photos and videos** that had no backup copies elsewhere.

✅ **Gained confidence** with deep-scan recovery tools, Windows system utilities, and data validation techniques.

✅ **Repartitioned the drive** for future use without overwriting the recovered data.

### **Skills Demonstrated:**

- Data recovery & disk diagnostics
- Windows system administration (CLI tools)
- File integrity verification (MD5 hashing)
- Media management and legacy hardware troubleshooting
- Adaptability and problem-solving in real-world scenarios
